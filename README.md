# ACM


I tried to solve the CTF given to me by ACM but was unable to do so, as reverse engineering is not my strong suit.
To find the the problem of the statement I visited many websites like:

I found out at there is a tool(IDA Freeware) that converts the file into the assembly code which helps in reverse engineer the script but I didn't understand how to analyse it.
In the end I wasn't able to get the get the flag.
